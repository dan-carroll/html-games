# HTML Games (with JavaScript)
Games are a fun way to spend your time. They can be relaxing or exciting, even educational. Some are quite challenging and can be great problem-solving mental exercises. So, however you enjoy your games, creating and playing your own creations can be a great way to learn programming techniques.

## A good way to "play" with some HTML JavaScript, and possibly enhance your (my) skill set.

## My Games (with code)

- [Hello](/hello.md) <a id="hello"></a> is not a game but an example page showing Javascript interactivity using the [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API). This is a simple, but cool, way to show how to store parameters for a page (game) locally and have the storage be persistent from session to session. See the [Javascript Basics](#a-good-way-to-play-with-some-html-javascript-and-possibly-enhance-your-my-skill-set) link above.
  - [hello.md](https://github.com/dan-carroll/html-games/blob/main/hello.md): page code.
  - [hello.js](https://github.com/dan-carroll/html-games/blob/main/assets/js/hello.js): javascript code.
