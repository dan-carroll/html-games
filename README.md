# HTML Games (with JavaScript)
Games are a fun way to spend your time. They can be relaxing or exciting, even educational. Some are quite challenging and can be great problem-solving mental exercises. So, however you enjoy your games, creating and playing your own creations can be a great way to learn programming techniques.
